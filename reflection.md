- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
Encapsulation denies access of class attributes outside of class, and replace it with getter methods. This adds a bit of extra work to access the information, but definitely makes them more secure.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
What worked: The code complied and the methods do what they should. However, adding passenger from Passenger.boardCar() would add the passenger twice, because I first checked the if statement, which runs addPassenger, then I call addPassenger again in the if condition. I haven't come up with a way to solve this.
